# MongoScraper
When you start the database, you can click the 'start database' button at the top of the page & it will scrape new articles from BBC. The scrape will include the image that matches the article, the title of the article & a link to the article.

Here's a video of the app scraping: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ENLQy8r0CmmiSwrA9IbLlMIfZA5YMIXa/view

When we started this we got some bad intel stating that NYT was now a paid site, so we couldn't scrape it, & so we decided to scrape the BBC page. BBC didn't have summaries however, so instead of grabbing title, summary & link, we grabbed the title, image & link.
